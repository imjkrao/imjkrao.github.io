I enjoy learning new language, knowing about awesome packages and it's capability. Experiment and implementing it in my small projects.

I know that we can't remember everything but i know where exactly to find those "everything".

Would love to see myself extract juice out of every dataset known to mankind.

I still use my first laptop
First computer: Dell Inspiron N5050
